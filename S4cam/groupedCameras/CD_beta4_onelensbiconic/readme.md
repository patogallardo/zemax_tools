# Exploring CD LATr with biconic lenses

What was tried:

1) Optimize for symmetric lenses

2) Allow L2 to be a biconic surface and optimize again

The system with only standard surfaces (radius of curvature and conic constant)
has this appearance

## Biconic L2

The lower cameras seem to be limited by the telecentric angle, which in this
case was set to be lower than 2.5 deg.
