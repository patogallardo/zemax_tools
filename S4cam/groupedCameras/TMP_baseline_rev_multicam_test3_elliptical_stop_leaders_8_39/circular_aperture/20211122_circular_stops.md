# Circular stops

The criterion I used was:

Set stop size until we reach a clearance of 150mm from an elliptical rim.

Example for the center camera (for a 41.7 mm stop semi diameter)

This also works when the footprint is a diagonal ellipse on the primary. The price to pay is a smaller stop of 39.6mm.

The distribution of the stop semi-diameters using this tool is:

Which has an assymetry in the left/right direction. This probably means the wedge needs some tweaking (Action item for me).

To do:
1. Tweak prism angles
2. Elliptical stop?
3. Groups
